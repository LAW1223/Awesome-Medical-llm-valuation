# E-NeRF: Neural Radiance Fields from a Moving Event Camera

Arxiv 2022

## Research Question:
	Whether an event stream from a DVS moving around the scene is sufficient to reconstruct a 3D representation of a static scene?


## Motivation:
(1)	Event camera instead of an RGB camera have several merits, including its ability to handle strong motion blur that exist in RGB images and could cause several RGB-based computer vision methods to fail. 
(2)	Event cameras do not suffer from motion blur and have already brought valuable contributions in the important and long-standing problems of hand and body tracking in this regard.
