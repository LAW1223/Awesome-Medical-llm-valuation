# Event-based Synthetic Aperture Imaging with a Hybrid Network

CVPR 2021

# Research Question

1) Conventional frame-based cameras introduce disturbance to the **Synthetic aperture imaging** when it comes to the very dense occlusions
and extreme lighting conditions.
2) How to effectively process the event stream and reconstruct the high quality visual images of occluded targets?
